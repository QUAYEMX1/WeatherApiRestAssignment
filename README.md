# üå¶Ô∏è Weather Information API

## Overview

**The Weather Information API** provides users with weather data based on a given pincode and date. It retrieves data from an external weather service (OpenWeatherMap) and caches results in a relational database for improved efficiency. This API allows users to obtain detailed weather information, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

## ‚ú® Features

- Retrieve weather information based on pincode and date.
- Cache weather data to avoid redundant API calls.
- Use of external geocoding service to convert pincode to latitude and longitude.
- Detailed weather details returned in the response.

## Project Structure

### üõ†Ô∏è Backend

- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Language**: Java
- **Development Environment**: IntelliJ IDEA

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The programming language used for developing the API.
- **Spring Boot**: A framework that simplifies the development of Java applications and provides a robust environment for building RESTful services.
- **JPA/Hibernate**: Used for object-relational mapping (ORM) to manage database interactions.
- **MySQL**: The relational database management system used to store weather data and locations.
- **Lombok**: A library that helps reduce boilerplate code in Java by automatically generating getters, setters, and other common methods.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: The external service used to fetch real-time weather data based on geographical coordinates.
- **RESTful API Design**: The architectural style used to create scalable and stateless web services.
- **JUnit**: A testing framework used for writing and running unit tests to ensure code quality.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 11 or higher
- Maven
- MySQL Database
- **An OpenWeatherMap API key** (sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get an API key).
- i have Provided  my API Key in Application.Properties, you can use the same to run the Application 
 src/main/resources/application.properties.
  - **Application.Properties=:**
  openweathermap.api.key=YOU WILL GET MY API KEY HERE
  
### Installation

1. ### Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository with the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QUAYEMX1/WeatherApiRestAssignment.git
cd WeatherApiRestAssignment
```

2. **Set Up the Backend**:
   - Open the backend project in IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Configure your application properties for the OpenWeatherMap API key.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the backend server using the command:
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run

## API Endpoints
### Get Weather Information

- **Endpoint**: `/api/weather/weatherInfo`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Parameters**:
  - `pincode` (required): The pincode for which weather information is requested.
  - `for_date` (required): The date for which the weather information is requested in the format `yyyy-MM-dd`.


### API Usage

- To retrieve the current weather information from pincode and current Date:
  localhost:8080/api/weather/weatherInfo?pincode={pincode}&for_date={date}

## Troubleshooting

- **Ensure you have the correct Java version**: This application is compatible with Java 17 or higher(21).
- **Check your API key**: Make sure OpenWeatherMap API key is valid and has the necessary permissions.
- **Port conflicts**: If port 8080 is already in use,you can change the port in `application.properties` by adding `server.port`=? (or any other available port e.g:8081).
## Conclusion

The Weather Information API is a powerful tool for retrieving real-time weather data based on pincode and date. By leveraging external services like OpenWeatherMap and implementing efficient caching mechanisms, this API provides users with accurate and timely weather information while minimizing unnecessary API calls.

Whether you're building applications that require weather data or simply looking to explore how to integrate external APIs, this project serves as a comprehensive guide. We welcome contributions and feedback to improve the functionality and usability of the API. Thank you for exploring the Weather Information API!
